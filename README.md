========================

This is a website I built for my wedding reception in May 2014. It's a one-page responsive scrolling site designed around big, beautiful images.

I used this site as a learning opportunity, as it's my first major web-design project outside of class assignments. I started with a tutorial by Ali Jafarian (http://alijafarian.com/responsive-page-scrolling-with-jquery-and-bootstrap/) on responsive page scrolling with jQuery and Bootstrap. I used ResponsiveSlides.js (http://responsiveslides.com/) for the photo gallery and Google PageSpeed tools (https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/) to optimize performance.
